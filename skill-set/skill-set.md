# Skill Set
- Through out my 14 years of sofware career, I have gained immense knowledge on various Technical skills. But never bothered to track them   under single roof. Project_X is created only for this purpose.
  
- My skils are listed under my [Murali Krishna Marimekala](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mmuralik/) linkedin page. I would like to add 
  each skill as one topic and gather information (as much as possible) which I learnt through out my career. 
  
- This skill set carries only generic skills like programming skills, debugging skills, integration skills, tools usage etc. 
  Will not be discussing any proprietary skills learnt for specific project purpose under Project_X.
