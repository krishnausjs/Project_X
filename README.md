## inspiration-from
I got inspired from 
- [ ] [Jwasham Git hub](https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university#why-use-it).

My readme may look similar to his as I am trying to follow the same path. Will try to keep it more simple than his github.

## what-is-it
This is 4 months plan to track my progress and brushup my old skills.
This Project X is not for my self improvement. If it helps anyone, that would be a bonus.
